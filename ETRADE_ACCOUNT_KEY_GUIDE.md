# E*TRADE Account Key Finder Guide

Based on the [E*TRADE Developer Documentation](https://developer.etrade.com/getting-started/developer-guides), here's how to find your correct account key:

## 🔍 **Step 1: Check Your E*TRADE Developer Portal**

1. **Log into your E*TRADE Developer Portal**
   - Go to: https://developer.etrade.com
   - Use the same credentials you used to get your API keys

2. **Look for Account Information**
   - Navigate to "My Apps" or "Applications"
   - Find your application (the one with consumer key: `d6a90e5e7904b5bc7c6e6c2d200a6884`)
   - Look for "Account Key", "Account ID", or "API Account Key"

## 🔍 **Step 2: Check Your E*TRADE Account Dashboard**

1. **Log into your E*TRADE account**
   - Go to: https://us.etrade.com
   - Look for account information

2. **Find the API Account Key**
   - The account key might be different from your account number
   - Look for "API Access" or "Developer Settings"
   - The account key might be in a different format (e.g., with dashes, underscores, or different length)

```

## 🔍 **Step 4: Contact E*TRADE Support**

If you can't find the account key:

1. **Send a Secure Message to E*TRADE**
   - Log into your E*TRADE account
   - Go to "Customer Service" → "Send a Secure Message"
   - Select subject: "Technical Issues"
   - Select topic: "E*TRADE API"
   - Ask for your API account key format

2. **Include in your message:**

   - Your account number: `377 274549`
   - Request the correct account key format for API calls

## 🔍 **Step 5: Test Different Formats**

Once you find a potential account key, test it:

```bash
# Update your .env file with the new account key
echo "ETRADE_ACCOUNT_ID=YOUR_NEW_ACCOUNT_KEY" >> .env

# Test the account key
python3 test_real_trading.py
```
